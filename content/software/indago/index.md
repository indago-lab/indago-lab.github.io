Indago is a Python 3 module for numerical optimization.

Indago contains several modern methods for real fitness function optimization over a real parameter domain. It was developed at the Department for Fluid Mechanics and Computational Engineering of the University of Rijeka, Faculty of Engineering, by Stefan Ivić, Siniša Družeta, Luka Grbčić, and others.

Indago is developed for in-house research and teaching purposes and is not officially supported in any way, comes with no guarantees whatsoever and is not properly documented. However, we use it regulary and it seems to be working fine. Hopefully you will find it useful as well.

## Installation

You can install Indago via pip: `pip install indago`
